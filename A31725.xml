            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CHARACTER Of an Honeſt, and Worthy Parliament-Man.</head>
            <p>I Hope the Reader will not be ſo unwife, as to expect that I ſhould here enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him with a Pompous Enumeration of all thoſe Imaginary Vertues, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Romantick Modellers of a Platonick, or Utopian Common-wealth, adorn their Paper Senators; when the Character even of a Real <hi>Cato,</hi> wou'd be altogether as uſeleſs in our Times, as it is rarely found to be practis'd; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently as little regarded now, as he himſelf was by the Corrupt Age wherein he lived: Not but that our Nation has of late produced as Great Heroes as any Antiquity can boaſt of, yet it cannot be imagined that they are to be found in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little Town or Borrough.</p>
            <p>As for my Honeſt and Worthy Parliament Man, all the Qualifications that I deſire to find in him, are only ſuch as it wou'd be the greateſt affront imaginable to any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman to think him deſtitute of: That is, that he ſhou'd be a Man of Senſe, Integrity and Honour. Let him but follow their Dictates, and then all the duties which we may reckon, or think of, to be incumbent on him; will be as eaſily performed by him, as they are demonſtrable to be the obvious, and Natural Conſequents of ſuch Principles.</p>
            <p>As for his Religion, he is a ſincere, as well as open Profeſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r of that which by our Laws is now become Eſſential to his Office, I mean, that of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Nor is he of it becauſe it is Eſtabliſh'd by Law, or that he was bred in it; but before he ſettled his Opinion, he maturely examin'd its firſt Principles, and found them agreeable to the Divine will, and Right Reaſon, he diſcovered the Folly and Errours of thoſe who oppoſe any points of its Doctrine: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing throughly ſatisfied in the Fundamentals, for its Diſcipline, he entirely ſubmits himſelf to the Judgment and Authority of thoſe to whoſe Conduct and Diſcretion the Government of the Church has been in all Ages committed.</p>
            <p>But tho' he be a zealous Church-man himſelf, yet he is ſo far from Perſecuting thoſe who Diſſent from the Eſtabliſht Religion purely for Conſcience ſake, that he is ready to pity their weakneſs, have Compaſſion on their Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and expreſs the greateſt Tenderneſs imaginable for their Perſons, whenever that time ſhall come, when it will be his chance to meet with thoſe, whoſe ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ariſe rather from a real defect in their underſtandings, than ſome Worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or deſire of Filthy Lucre, an Obſtinate, Peeviſh, or Self-conceited Humour, or the vain glorious Spirit of Contradiction.</p>
            <p>As for his Sentiments in State Affairs, in which next to his Religion, his greateſt deſire is to be Orthodox; before they fixt, he always tries them with the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of Reaſon; and conſequently thinks it Lawful for him to be a <hi>Latitudinarian</hi> in Judgment in Relation to Civil Matters: I mean ſo far as not to expect to find an Infallible Judge, amongſt either <hi>Torys, Whigs,</hi> or <hi>Trimmers.</hi> He takes up Opinions upon truſt from no Party, nor condemns any, becauſe they are of it, who differ from him in other things: And therefore he cou'd not but ſmile, to ſee in
<pb facs="tcp:48271:2"/>our late Times of Diſſention, ſo many in all outward appearance Honeſt, and thinking men, continually jogg on, like a Gang of Pack-Horſes after the Leaders of their ſeveral Parties; and tho they wander, after theſe Blazing, butdeceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lights, into never ſo many Crooked and by paths, yet with an Implicit and Blind Faith, ſtill believe themſelves to be in the right way.</p>
            <p>For his part, his only aim is at the Honour, Safety, and Intereſt of his Countrey: On this Mark, he keeps his eye conſtantly fixt; nor can the dreadful Frowns of an Enraged Prince, or the horrid Clamours of a poſſeſs'd Multitude; ever be able to remove him from his point. He finds that his beloved vertue brings ſuch ſolid, tho inviſible rewards along with her, that he is equally inſenſible to the promiſing ſmiles of fawning great ones that wou'd tempt, and the terrible menaces of the Fierceſt Demagogues, that wou'd force him to forſake her. He can ſecurely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Fear of Infection, deride the folly, and pity the madneſs of thoſe who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit their Honeſty, to found their happineſs, upon the unſtable Baſis of Court Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, or Popular Applauſe.</p>
            <p>He truly enjoys all that Freedom in his Actions, which he thinks his Duty to procure for, and defend his Countrey-men in. He is wholly a ſtranger to the ſervile Ambition of gaining the favourable Opinion of others; nor can he tell what it is to fear the Cenſures of any: He is Directed, Influenc'd, or Byaſs'd by none; And whilſt he is engaged in his Countries ſervice, he thinks the moſt Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Epithetes the World can fix upon him, are thoſe of a Rigid Inflexible Ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd Honeſt Man.</p>
            <p>When he diſcovers that any have Deſigns contrary to the Publick good, let their Authority and Power be never ſo great, he oppoſes their Opinions, with all the Courage and Zeal his generous Principles can furniſh him with; without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their Perſons. But when the time comes, wherein the right ſide ſhall turn uppermoſt, as after all Revolutions it ever will at laſt, he is then ſo far from trampling upon his faln Adverſaries, tho he becomes, I mean as a private Man, moſt tender of the Perſons without any Reſpect to their Opinions.</p>
            <p>He is altogether unacquainted with that baſe and degenerate Paſſion called Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred: Yet there is one ſort of Men whom he thinks worthy of the utmoſt Degree of his Contempt and Scorn; I mean thoſe falſe and Treacherous Friends, who have formerly gone along with, nay, much before him in the ſame Cauſe; thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Zealots for their Country and Religion, who for their own Paultry In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or ſome by ends made it their buſineſs to ſet us together by the Ears, with their noſy Clamours againſt Popery and Slavery: But when the danger was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come real, and juſt hanging over our Heads, when our Church and State were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for immediate Ruin, with the ſame Mercenary breath ſervilly offer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be employ'd as Tools, in the Deſtruction of them both. Theſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives ought to have a mark put upon them, as the worſt of Traytors; he takes them to be the vileſt of Men, or rather (to uſe he expreſſion of one who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may think himſelf cocern'd, here) to carry <hi>nothing of men, that is,</hi> Engliſh <hi>Men, but the ſhape.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I now find my ſelf neceſſiated, to take my hand from off the Tablet, leſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of compleating the Portraicture of an Honeſt Parliament-man I ſhou'd inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly touch upon them, who deſerve another Character. My intention then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like my Honeſt Patriots, willingly to offend no man, I ſhall take my leave of him at preſent, with this Remark only, That a Nation where ſuch as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, at the Helm, will without doubt be altogether as happy, as if it were Steer'd by <hi>Plato's</hi> Philoſophizing Governours, or Governing Philoſophers.</p>
